# Intelese-task
1. Build an tensorflow  or keras model that can identify high peak in an audio by separating it from a video data that is caused by a surge, example gunshot accident scream etc 2. Build a flask api where the API can receive the video url or audio url to be passed as an argument 3. The program should be able to provide the output via response or stored locally as a file 4. Also Dockerize the model such that the API is exposed to the port number 0.0.0.0:8080 or localhost:5000 as per the arguments passed.
